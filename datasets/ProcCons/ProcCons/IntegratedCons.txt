Weight, hand grip could be rubberized
Heavy, over-kill software, Poor focus characteristics, bad macro ability. incorrect color matching.
Refer review body.
Rear case material, lens cover, raw image converter software

Plastic body can break if dropped.  
none I can think of
slow, and expensive. 
Some advanced features available only in AE mode, some minor flaws and annoyances.

USB-cable offloading of IMGs is problematic; 'SmartMedia' storage cards are pricey; no image stablization.
Would be even better with an optical viewfinder an a few other options.
Short battery life
Smartmedia 64 megs limits number of pictures at highest resolution
Viewfinder impossible to use outside with sun glasses, and difficult without them
flash broken when purchased and had to be replaced
eats your hard-drive; relative expense of smart media cards, multimedia applications
The indoor shots look grainy, even with flash; no audio with video

I wish it had a burst mode like the olympus d-340-r to allow for fast action and recording of sporting events. I can learn to live without it especially since the quality of the printed pictures is so much better than the Olympus.
Smart media card storage
Getting over switching from film to disk
Poor quality and eats batteries
Want to take pic's all the time

N60 body, ISO 320, no spot meter, Menus and operation are not intuitive.
price
As any flexible camera, that is with many controls and posibilities, NOT for newcomers, not for point and shooters. Instruction manual fairly good, Nikon has used video on halide cameras to help learn many controls; may be Fuji should do same.
I didn't find any yet.
F60 body, ISO 320 is the lowest rating
some bleeding at high res
A storage and power hog. It can get expensive fast.

3.3m effective pixels, high price, missing some useful features
The S602 is a real power hog
