2,"Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie ."
5,"Chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement ."
4,"While it would be easy to give Crush the new title of Two Weddings and a Funeral , it 's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of Hugh Grant whimsy ."
1,"This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through ."
4,"While Undercover Brother is definitely one for the masses , it 's also full of sharp , smart satire ."
3,"Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary ."
